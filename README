This is a Python implementation of simplekit. Simplekit is intended as a
pedagogical teaching tool for discrete event modeling, based on Schruben's
Event Graphs.

Simplekit requires 'numpy'.

The master branch is now a Python 3.x implementation.  Check out the `python2`
branch if you need a Python 2.7.x implementation.
