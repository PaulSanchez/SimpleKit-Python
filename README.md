This is a Python implementation of simplekit. Simplekit is intended as a
pedagogical teaching tool for discrete event modeling, based on Schruben's
Event Graphs.

See the SimulationBasics.pdf for a quick introduction to discrete
event modeling, an explanation of SimpleKit's architecture, and a
working example of queueing model.

Simplekit requires `numpy`.

The master branch has been updated to a Python 3.x implementation.
Check out the `python2` branch if you need a Python 2.7.x implementation.
